## Introduction
Tilapia is ideal for Zimbabwe's climate and grows well in ponds and tanks.

## Getting Started

### Site Selection
- Reliable water source
- Good soil for pond construction
- Flat or gently sloping land
- Away from flood areas

### Pond Construction
**Size:** 200-500 m²
**Depth:** 1-1.5 meters
**Shape:** Rectangular preferred
**Bottom:** Slightly sloped for drainage

### Water Quality Requirements
- Temperature: 25-30°C (optimal)
- pH: 6.5-8.5
- Dissolved Oxygen: >5 mg/L
- Ammonia: <0.1 mg/L

## Stocking

### Fingerling Selection
- Size: 5-10 grams
- Source: Reputable hatcheries
- Health: Active, no deformities

### Stocking Density
- Extensive: 1-2 fish/m²
- Semi-intensive: 3-5 fish/m²
- Intensive: 5-10 fish/m²

## Feeding

### Feed Types
- Commercial pellets (32-40% protein)
- Farm-made feed
- Supplementary feeds

### Feeding Schedule
- Fingerlings: 4-5 times daily
- Juveniles: 3 times daily
- Adults: 2 times daily

### Feed Amount
- 3-5% of body weight daily
- Adjust based on growth

## Water Management

### Water Quality Monitoring
- Test pH weekly
- Check temperature daily
- Monitor oxygen levels
- Watch for ammonia buildup

### Pond Maintenance
- Remove debris regularly
- Partial water changes (10-20% weekly)
- Clean filters/aerators
- Control algae growth

## Disease Prevention

### Common Diseases
**Bacterial Infections:**
- Symptoms: Lesions, fin rot
- Treatment: Antibiotics (veterinary advice)

**Parasites:**
- Symptoms: Flashing, scratching
- Treatment: Salt baths, proper medication

**Fungal Infections:**
- Symptoms: Cotton-like growth
- Treatment: Antifungal medication

### Prevention
- Maintain good water quality
- Avoid overstocking
- Quarantine new fish
- Proper nutrition

## Growth and Harvesting

### Growth Timeline
- Fingerling to market size: 6-8 months
- Market size: 300-500 grams

### Harvesting Methods
- Total harvest: Drain pond
- Partial harvest: Seine net
- Selective harvest: Cast net

### Post-Harvest Handling
- Clean immediately
- Gut and scale
- Ice or process quickly
- Maintain cold chain

## Economics

### Initial Investment (0.05 ha pond)
- Pond construction: $1,500-2,500
- Fingerlings: $200-300
- Feed (6 months): $500-800
- Equipment: $300-500
**Total: $2,500-4,100**

### Revenue (per cycle)
- Production: 1,500-2,000 kg
- Price: $3-4/kg
- Gross income: $4,500-8,000
- Net profit: $2,000-4,000

### ROI Timeline
- Break-even: 1-2 years
- Good management: High profitability
